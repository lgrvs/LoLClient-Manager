## Building it yourself
If you want to compile the project yourself, compile the intercepter first, then replace intercepmgr.exe in the resources with yours and check that its SHA256 matches the one set in the GUI source code (macro TOOL_HASH in widget.h). If it doesn't, simply replace it with yours, otherwise your build won't be recognized.
(Qt is needed to build the GUI app)
